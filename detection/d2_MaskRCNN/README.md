# ðŸŽˆ Detectron2 Instance Segmentation Tutorial (Mask R-CNN Series)

This repository provides a complete tutorial series on using **Mask R-CNN** for instance segmentation with [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2), a modular and flexible object detection framework developed by Facebook AI Research (FAIR).

Mask R-CNN not only detects object bounding boxes but also generates a high-quality segmentation mask for each instance, making it a powerful tool for pixel-level analysis in computer vision.

## ðŸŽˆ Dataset Description: Balloon
- **Source:** [Matterport Balloon Dataset](https://github.com/matterport/Mask_RCNN/tree/master/samples/balloon) provided by Waleed Abdulla
- **Target:** Simple but effective dataset to demonstrate instance segmentation tasks with non-rectangular objects. Each image contains one or more balloons with polygon-style instance annotations.
- **Format:**  LabelMe JSON  
- **Structure:** 
  ```
    â”œâ”€â”€ train
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ image1
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ image1.json
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ image2
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ image2.json
    â””â”€â”€ val
        â”œâ”€â”€ image1
        â”œâ”€â”€ image1.json
        â”œâ”€â”€ image2
        â””â”€â”€ image2.json
  ```

## ðŸ“Œ Notes & Tips

- Use `DefaultTrainer` or build a custom trainer for flexible training logic
- Use `Visualizer(draw_instance_predictions)` to overlay masks with transparency
- Resize images or limit batch size to reduce memory consumption
