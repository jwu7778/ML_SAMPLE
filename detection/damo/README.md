# 🚀 DAMO-YOLO Defect Detection Pipeline

This repository demonstrates how to train and evaluate object detection models using [DAMO-YOLO](https://github.com/tinyvision/DAMO-YOLO).  
It is specifically configured to work with the [GC10-Det](https://datasetninja.com/gc10-det) industrial surface defect dataset.

## 📘 Available Notebooks

1. **`DAMO_Training.ipynb`**  
   Sets up the environment and trains a DAMO-YOLO model using a lightweight **subset of the GC10-Det dataset**.  
   Useful for verifying model structure, training flow, and initial performance on defect detection.

2. **`DAMO_Inference.ipynb`**  
   Loads a trained model and performs inference on new images.  
   Demonstrates how to visualize detection results and interpret model performance.

> 📝 Each notebook is self-contained but logically ordered.  
> Start from training, then proceed to inference.
