# 🐢 Panoptic Segmentation Tutorial (Detectron2)

This repository provides a practical walkthrough for inferencing a pretrained panoptic segmentation model using **Detectron2**.

We cover:
- Pretrained panoptic segmentation inference (e.g., model trained with COCO dataset)

---

## 📘 Available Notebooks

1. **`Inference PreTrained Panoptic Segmentation.ipynb`**  
   - Demonstrates how to perform panoptic segmentation on sample images using a pretrained **PanopticFPN** model.
   - Inference is run directly on Detectron2-provided COCO weights.
   - Includes visualization of segmented outputs.

> 📝 Make sure to install Detectron2 and required dependencies before running the notebooks.
